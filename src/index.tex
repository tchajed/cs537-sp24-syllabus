\section*{Assignments \& Grading}

\section*{Late policy}

For the programming exercises, you get up to 3 ``late days'' to use throughout
the semester. You don't need to tell me when you use these, just submit late. If
you have extenuating circumstances and need more time, let me know as soon as
possible.

Reading assignments can't be turned in after the deadline since we'll be
discussing the paper on that day. However, if you miss one, it'll be dropped and
you can still get full credit (I still encourage you to read the paper later
even if you don't submit a review).
